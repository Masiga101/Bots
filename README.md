This a a simple Node Js project. The code is in one file, index.js. It has all the code for the server. I used [Telegraf](https://telegraf.js.org/) for the telegram bot that can send users definitions of words. It's as simple as can be, but I'm proud of it. You can view a  live demo [here](https://t.me/lilongangi_bot). I implemented the [Merriam Webster](https://dictionaryapi.com/) dictionary as my api for fetching meaning of words.

I also have a discord bot within the server still improving on it. Hoping to add more functionalities to these bots. Used the [discord js library](https://discord.js.org/#/)

Also have a chat bot implemented using Google's Dialogflow [here](https://t.me/allMail_bot). It's a work in progress.
